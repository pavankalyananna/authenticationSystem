User Authentication System

A secure and scalable authentication system built using Spring Boot and Spring Security, designed to manage user registration, login, and role-based access control. The system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure stateless and efficient authentication across client–server communication. User data and access privileges are persisted using Hibernate with a MySQL database.

Key Features

1) User Registration & Login: Secure on-boarding with encrypted password storage.
2) JWT-Based Authentication: Stateless session handling with token generation and validation.
3) Role-Based Access Control: Managed user roles (Admin/User) with restricted endpoint access.
4) Secure APIs: Protected REST endpoints using Spring Security filters and authorization rules.
5) Database Persistence: Hibernate ORM for seamless mapping to MySQL tables.
6) Error Handling: Clear responses for invalid credentials, expired tokens, and unauthorised access.
